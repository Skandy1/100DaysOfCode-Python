# Day-52

Today's topic was **Selenium Driver for Automation** in python which was wonderfully explained by  [Dr.Angelea Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/). 

### What did I learn?

1. Selenium web driver in python.
2. Finding elements using selectors such as **name, tag, link text, etc**
3. Instagram Bot

## Project of the day

**Instagram Follower Bot** using the above mentioned topics. You can checkout my code [here](InstagramFollowerBot/main.py). 

:put_litter_in_its_place:Don't forget to add your credentials in [keys.py](InstagramFollowerBot/keys.py) file.

# Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank **MYSELF** for being _self-motivated_ throughout the lecture. 

### Suggestion

- For all those who can understand English in a fast pace and catch up what the instructor is trying to convey can choose to watch the video at **1.25x** speed which reduces the watch time and meanwhile you can keep the remaining time for practice.
