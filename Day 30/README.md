# Day-30

  **A month already?** Today's topics was **Errors, Exception and JSON ** in python, which was wonderfully explained by   [Dr.Angelea Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/). 

### What did I learn?

1. Types of exceptions: FileNotFoundError, KeyError, IndexError and TypeError.

2. Handling exceptions in python

   ```python
   try:
       ...
   except:
       ...
   else:
       ...
   finally:
       ...
   ```

3. JSON - dump(), load(), update()

## Project of the day

**Password Manager storing using JSON** using Tkinter package. You can checkout my code [here](PasswordManagerJSON/main.py). You can also clone and run on local machine using an IDE.

# Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank **MYSELF** for being _self-motivated_ throughout the lecture. 

### Suggestion

- For all those who can understand English in a fast pace and catch up what the instructor is trying to convey can choose to watch the video at **1.2x** speed which reduces the watch time and meanwhile you can keep the remaining time for practice.
