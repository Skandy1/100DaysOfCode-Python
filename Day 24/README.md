# Day-24

**There is no right Solution**.   Today's topics was **Files, Directories and paths** in python, which was wonderfully explained by   [Dr.Angelea Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/). 

### What did I learn?

1. Files using 

   ```python
   open(filename, mode)
   ```

2. open(), read(),  readlines(), write() methods in file.

3. ```python
   with open(xyz) as x:
       ...
       ...
   ```

4. Absolute and Relative paths in Python.



## Project of the day

**Mail Merge** using files. You can checkout my code [here](MailMerge/main.py). You can also clone and run on local machine using an IDE.

# Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank **MYSELF** for being _self-motivated_ throughout the lecture. 

### Suggestion

- For all those who can understand English in a fast pace and catch up what the instructor is trying to convey can choose to watch the video at **1.2x** speed which reduces the watch time and meanwhile you can keep the remaining time for practice.
