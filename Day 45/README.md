# Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank **MYSELF** for being _self-motivated_ throughout the lecture. 

### Suggestion

- For all those who can understand English in a fast pace and catch up what the instructor is trying to convey can choose to watch the video at **1.25x** speed which reduces the watch time and meanwhile you can keep the remaining time for practice.
