# Day-68

 Today's topic was **REST API** which was wonderfully explained by  [Dr.Angelea Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/). 

### What did I learn?

1. Uses of REST API and creating RESTful API using Flask.
2. Using [Postman](https://postman.com/) for making API requests.
3. Using **werkzeug** and **flask_login** to making authentication of users even better.  

## Project of the day

**Flask Authentication** using the above mentioned topics. You can check out my project [here](FlaskAuth/main.py).

# Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank **MYSELF** for being _self-motivated_ throughout the lecture. 

### Suggestion

- For all those who can understand English in a fast pace and catch up what the instructor is trying to convey can choose to watch the video at **1.25x** speed which reduces the watch time and meanwhile you can keep the remaining time for practice.
