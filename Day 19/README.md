# Day-19

**Expand the solution to your limits**.   Today's topic was **Instances, State and Event Listeners **, which was wonderfully explained by   [Dr.Angelea Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/). 

### What did I learn?

1. Passing function as an input.
2. Higher order function.
3. Object state and instance.
4. [Etch-a-Sketch](https://replit.com/@skandasharma/Challenge-1-1)



## Project of the day

**Turtle Race** using Turtle Package. You can checkout my code [here](TurtleRace/main.py). You can also clone and run on local machine using an IDE.

# Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank **MYSELF** for being _self-motivated_ throughout the lecture. 

### Suggestion

- For all those who can understand English in a fast pace and catch up what the instructor is trying to convey can choose to watch the video at **1.2x** speed which reduces the watch time and meanwhile you can keep the remaining time for practice.
