3. Play Computer and evaluate each segment of code.
4. Using Print Statement
5. Using Debugger.
6. Tips: 
   - Take a break.
   - Ask a friend .
   - Run often to find small errors.
   - Use [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/)



## Project of the day

2. [Leap Year](https://replit.com/@skandasharma/Leap-Year-Debug)

# Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank **MYSELF** for being _self-motivated_ throughout the lecture. 

### Suggestion

- For all those who can understand English in a fast pace and catch up what the instructor is trying to convey can choose to watch the video at **1.2x** speed which reduces the watch time and meanwhile you can keep the remaining time for practice.
