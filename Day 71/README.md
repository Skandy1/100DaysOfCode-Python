# Day-71

 Today's topic was **Pandas** which was wonderfully explained by  [Dr.Angelea Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/). 

### What did I learn?

1. Use of ``` .head(), .tail(), .shape, .columns``` to explore DataFrame
2. Looking for NaN values ``` .findna()``` and ``` .dropna()```
3. Accessing the data within the DataFrame using ``` df[column name]```
4. The largest and smallest values, as well as their positions ``` .max(), .idxmax()```
5. Sorting and inserting new columns into the DataFrame using ``` .sort_values()``` and ``` .insert()```
6. Grouping the values based on particular column using ``` .groupby()```

## Project of the day

**Exploring Data** using the above mentioned topics. You can check out my project [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Kif41Rrh1PpqaVggscXiGVdAi5xQ8lya?usp=sharing).  

# Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank **MYSELF** for being _self-motivated_ throughout the lecture. 

### Suggestion

- For all those who can understand English in a fast pace and catch up what the instructor is trying to convey can choose to watch the video at **1.25x** speed which reduces the watch time and meanwhile you can keep the remaining time for practice.
