# Day-57

Today's topic was **Flask Framework** in python which was wonderfully explained by  [Dr.Angelea Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/). 

### What did I learn?

1. Jinja and it's integration with templates.

2. Using certain styles to format python code inside html.

   ```python
   {{....}} # single line python code
   {% ... %} # multi line python code
   ```

3. Using **url_for()** to generate dynamic url within html using python.

## Project of the day

**Blog site** using the above mentioned topics. You can check out my code [here](MyBlogFlask/main.py).

# Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank **MYSELF** for being _self-motivated_ throughout the lecture. 

### Suggestion

- For all those who can understand English in a fast pace and catch up what the instructor is trying to convey can choose to watch the video at **1.25x** speed which reduces the watch time and meanwhile you can keep the remaining time for practice.
