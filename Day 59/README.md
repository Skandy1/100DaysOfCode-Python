# Day-59

Today's topic was **Flask** which was wonderfully explained by  [Dr.Angelea Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/). 

### What did I learn?

After having a wonderful glance on how to use BootStrap to make amazing websites, in today's lecture I learnt how to modify what I did on Day 57 which was a basic blogsite. 

1. Rendering pages using flask.
2. Dynamic loading of pages and adding url.

## Project of the day

**Blog Site** using the above mentioned topics. You can check out my code [here](BlogBSFlask/main.py).

# Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank **MYSELF** for being _self-motivated_ throughout the lecture. 

### Suggestion

- For all those who can understand English in a fast pace and catch up what the instructor is trying to convey can choose to watch the video at **1.25x** speed which reduces the watch time and meanwhile you can keep the remaining time for practice.
