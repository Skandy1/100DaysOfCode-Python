## Project of the day

Using all the skills that I learnt in today's lecture, I am proud to say that I made a **Random Password Generator** using random module, lists and for loop. You can check out my code [here](https://replit.com/@skandasharma/password-generator).

# Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank **MYSELF** for being _self-motivated_ throughout the lecture. 

### Suggestion

- For all those who can understand English in a fast pace and catch up what the instructor is trying to convey can choose to watch the video at **1.2x** speed which reduces the watch time and meanwhile you can keep the remaining time for practice.
