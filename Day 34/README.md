  **~Don't waste time on stuff that don't work your way~** Today's topics was **Quiz App using TRIVIA API** in python, which was wonderfully explained by   [Dr.Angelea Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/). 

### What did I use?

1. Usage of TRIVIA API.

2. Parameters that are accepted by TRIVIA API.

3. unescaping HTML entities

   ```python
   html.unescape(...)
   ```

4. Type Hints in Python.

## Project of the day

# Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank **MYSELF** for being _self-motivated_ throughout the lecture. 

### Suggestion

- For all those who can understand English in a fast pace and catch up what the instructor is trying to convey can choose to watch the video at **1.2x** speed which reduces the watch time and meanwhile you can keep the remaining time for practice.
