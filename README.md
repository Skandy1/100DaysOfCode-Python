# 100 days of code challenge

This repository is a **_log book_** for my coding challenge on python. Making it a point that I will practice on a daily basis even after the course is completed. [Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/) has made an excellent course on python and it really helps those who are looking forward to become an expert in **Python**. The reason behind taking up this course is to excel in **competitive programming** and also  for my upcoming interviews.
