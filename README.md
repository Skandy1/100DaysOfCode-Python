# What and Why?

The only question I keep asking myself throughout this course is **What is the main reason that I ended up taking this course ?** and **Why am I taking this course?** Answer lies within me, I always wanted to become a proficient **DEVELOPER** in atleast one particular programming language and I felt difficult choosing the ONE. Finally, found this wonderful course on _udemy_ by an excellent instructor [Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/) titled [100 days of code](https://www.udemy.com/share/103IHM/) which brings in all aspects of programming from beginner to expert. I have my interviews lined up and need to crack technical rounds with a ease, keeping this course in mind I think it will be of great help towards achieving it easily.

# Day-1

It does feel like "First day of school" where a kid is exposed to new environment and feels unknown for a while. Since I have been coding past 7 years and code at DS and ALGO gave me an advantage to crack the first day easily.

### What did I learn?

1. [Riplit](https://replit.com/) -> Excellent place to run python scripts, has repository scheme to maintain all the programs at one palce.
2. Basic syntax of Python
3. String manipulation
4. Commenting
5. len() function
6. Variables
7. Debugging the code using [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) editor which is excellent and light weight.

## Project of the day

Using all the skills that I learnt in today's lecture, I am proud to announce that I made a **string manipulation project** on brand name generator. You can check out my code [here](https://replit.com/@skandasharma/band-name-generator).

# Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank **MYSELF** for being _self-motivated_ throughout the lecture. 

### Suggestion

- For all those who can understand english in a fast pace and catch up what the instructor is trying to convey can choose to watch the video at **1.2x** speed which reduces the watch time and meanwhile you can keep the remaining time for practice.
